00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,759
Hello, in this video I will show the
installation, configuration, and

2
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:13,000
usage process of the Smart Edu plugin.
First, you should go to the Moodle

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,600
plugins page and download the Smart Edu
plugin by clicking the download option

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,279
and then downloading the latest version
of the plugin. I already have the plugin

5
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:29,720
installed here. So now I go to my Moodle,
choose the plugin option, install plugin,

6
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:36,840
and upload the file
I just downloaded.

7
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:43,360
Then just click to install the plugin
from the .zip file.

8
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,360
After that, you will see the plugin
configuration screen,

9
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:54,239
where you can choose your AI provider.
Among the options,

10
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,199
we have Gemini, ChatGPT, and a local version with Llama. You will enter

11
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:04,760
the API access key of the provider you chose, and the model you want to use.

12
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:10,880
For example, in the case of Google Gemini, you have Gemini 2.0 Flash.

13
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,000
You can also, in the case of
local providers, enter the API access

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,400
for your AI and choose whether or not to enable the use of prompts,

15
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:27,000
the prompt cache. By enabling this option,

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,840
you will save the number of requests
to your AI provider, since the plugin detects

17
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,240
whether that prompt has already been queried and does not make a new request,

18
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:44,280
only returns the result it previously obtained.

19
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:51,159
Once configured, I can now go to a
specific course

20
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:56,479
and, by enabling edit mode, add the
Smart Edu intelligent learning block.

21
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:03,520
When you do this, you will notice
on the right side of the screen,

22
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,439
or depending on your theme, in other locations, a block called Smart Edu.

23
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:13,000
Here we can see some things.

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,080
In this information security course,
I have a discussion forum, a course plan,

25
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:26,080
which is a PDF file, and two PDF files
with lecture notes.

26
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,400
The plugin shows an icon for the
discussion forum,

27
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,319
meaning that this resource is
available to the plugin.

28
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:42,920
By clicking it, the plugin generates a
summary of the discussions

29
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,959
that took place in that forum. For example,
I can see that I had five interactions

30
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,599
and the plugin summarized them.
This is useful for the teacher

31
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,920
or tutor to get an overview of
the discussion

32
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:04,360
before reading each post.
Here we can also see the course plan file.

33
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,280
The course plan is a file
that contains information about the

34
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,200
course schedule. It may not be interesting for the teacher to make this file

35
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,599
available to the plugin,

36
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:19,519
since it does not make sense to generate summaries, questions,

37
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,879
or mind maps from files like this.
To prevent this file from being processed by the plugin,

38
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:32,159
the teacher can edit the file settings
and add the Smart Edu hide tag.

39
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:37,920
After doing this, you will notice that
the file disappears from the plugin links.

40
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,439
Note that it is still available to the student,
but the plugin will no longer

41
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,439
consider it for requests.

42
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:51,360
The other file is a lecture notes file for
the course, called General Concepts

43
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,519
of Information Security, part one.
When clicking on this file,

44
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:01,200
the plugin generates a summary of the
PDF lecture notes,

45
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,480
a study guide for the student,
and also a mind map

46
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,599
about the concepts covered in that class.
The plugin uses only the content from

47
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,120
the file itself to avoid hallucinations.

48
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,759
It also generates a set of multiple-choice questions,

49
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,680
with which the student can interact
and then submit the results.

50
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,360
The plugin shows the answer options,
the correct answers, and provides feedback.

51
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,199
When the student answers incorrectly,
feedback is also displayed.

52
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,520
All of this can be configured
by the teacher.

53
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,120
The teacher just needs to click the
three dots

54
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,600
and choose Configure block.
They can choose between a detailed or simple summary,

55
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,639
whether or not to use questions,
and how many questions to generate,

56
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:58,479
from one to seven. Here I will keep five,
as it was before.

57
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,919
They can also choose whether or not to generate a study guide and, in the same way,

58
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:07,800
whether or not to generate a mind map.
The third feature I would like to comment on

59
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,840
is the case where the teacher provides lecture notes,

60
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,280
but they are still hidden from students,

61
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,639
because the course has
not yet reached that content.

62
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:25,919
On the right side of the plugin,
we can see that the resource is available

63
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,017
to the teacher,

64
00:05:27,017 --> 00:05:30,017
but it appears as hidden for students.

65
00:05:30,017 --> 00:05:40,160
This means the student does not have access to that content.
To verify this situation, I will now log out

66
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,160
and log in as a student.
Now I am authenticated with

67
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:52,160
the student profile,
and I cannot see the content

68
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,000
made available by the teacher,
which is part two of the lecture notes

69
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,160
on general information security concepts.

70
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:07,800
For all content that is available,
the student has the same functionalities as the teacher.

71
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,680
This was the presentation of the Smart Edu plugin.
I hope you enjoyed it.
